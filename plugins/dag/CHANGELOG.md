# Changelog — dag plugin

All notable changes to the `dag` plugin are documented here.
This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.1] — 2026-07-05

### Changed
- Paraphrased the expressive third-party **blog quotations** in the persona catalog
  (Martin Fowler's *TestPyramid* and *Eradicating Non-Determinism in Tests*, the Testing Library
  guiding principle, and Unosquare / em-tools.io T-shaped-engineer commentary) into original
  wording, with their attributions preserved. The factual certification-body, standards-body,
  official-doc, and job-posting quotes are unchanged (fair-use quotation). No behavior change.

### Added
- Plugin README: an **MIT license** line and a **"Verify the formal claims yourself"** section —
  the one-command TLC re-run (expect 327 distinct states, no error) with a pointer to
  `references/formal-models.md` for the full transcript and the Alloy models.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-07-05

### Added
- Initial release of the `dag` gated, multi-phase task-execution pipeline:
  - **Socratic persona selection** (Phase 1) from a curated per-file JSON catalog plus
    user (`~/.claude/dag/personas/`) and project (`.dag/personas/`) personas, all under one
    uniform `persona.schema.json`.
  - **Exhaustive clarification** (Phase 2) with a materiality-ranked ambiguity register and a
    mandatory Definition of Done + Non-Goals/Guardrails.
  - **Contextual cartography** (Phase 3), **atomic work-unit decomposition + dependency DAG**
    (Phase 4), and **self-contained per-unit briefings** (Phase 5).
  - **Budget-capped subagent executors** (propose/critique) with **independent adversarial
    verification** of every work unit (Phase 6), a **disagreement gate** (Phase 7), and
    **synthesis + sign-off** (Phase 8).
  - **Formally-enforced invariants** — JSON Schemas + a finite-state-machine spec + a runnable
    validator (`scripts/validate_run.py`) that mechanically rejects malformed runs, plus a
    **TLA+/Alloy formal-model layer** (TLA+ machine-checked with TLC; Alloy hand-proved).
  - **Adaptive anti-hallucination evidence standards** and a durable
    plan/decision/progress/learnings ledger.
- Companion **`dag:personas`** skill to list/add/modify/remove reusable persona JSON files
  across the project, user, and built-in catalog sources.
